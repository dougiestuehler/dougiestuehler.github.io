My work is supported by a devotion to reduce ambiguity and set biologically informed standards in bioinformatic research.</div>
            <div class="text">I am currently a research scholar of Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Molecular Biology in the USDA-ARS Heck lab at Cornell University, Ithaca. I earned my BS in Molecular biology with a minor in Chemistry in 2021 from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The major focus of my current research entails finding chinks in the armor of the Huanglongbing tritrpohic pathosystem consisting of pathogen <em>Candidatus</em> Liberibacter asiaticus (<em>C</em>Las), vector <em>Diaphorina citri</em>, and host citrus species.</div>

I have worked on protocols to enrich for non-eukayotic DNA allowing for deepened sequencing of microbial communities from individual insects. CLas-enriched DNA sequencing paired with strain tracking and high quality SNP analysis will help to trace any outbreaks of antibiotic resistant CLas strains.</div>

            <div class="text">My first project with the USDA-ARS was to characterize a novel picorna-like virus in <em>L. fagarae</em>, a closely related psyllid of <em>D. citri</em>. The use of virus capsid architecture to deliver siRNAs is efficient and the identification of a new virus solidifies the picorna-like virus as a well established infector of psyllids in Florida. </div>

Pathway enrichment revealed transcripts belonging to Plant-pathogen interaction pathways were upregualted in tolerant genotypes and downregualted in susceptible genotypes. The identification of these genes has helped to broaden our understanding of plant immunity and effector biology. </div>

            <div class="text">One of my favorite projects is involved with the immune system of stingrays in collaboration with the winners of the 2022 ARSX competition. My part in the project was to assemble and annotate the genomes of the Atlantic and Southern stingrays in order to characterized germline IgNAR loci. As a single domain heavy chain antibody, the IgNAR and its variable region (VNAR) showcases a highly adaptable, stable, and nimble therapeutic molecule. We look to characterize the genetics behind this antibody and explore its use in plants, to bolster their immune systems and fight off foreign pathogens.</div>

            <div class="text">One of the most complicated genomes I have worked with is that of <em>Gossypium hirsutum</em>, an allopolyploid species contributing to at least 90% of cotton production worldwide. Members of the Heck laboratory classified an undiscovered DNA virus, cotton virus A (CotV-A), which now has endogenous sequence identified in many commerical and wild cotton species. My role for this project was to perform chromosomal synteny analysis of <em>G. hirsutum</em> varieties, pathway enrichment analysis of genes surrounding sites of CotV-A integration in <em>G. hirsutum</em> varities, and to classify the aphid transmission factor (ATF) and the virion-associated protein (VAP) through structural analysis. </div>

            <div class="text">Viral modulation of host insect sRNA response is a well documented phenomema in entomology, however to the extent at which this modulation is related to other pathogens (viruses and bacteria) within the host insect is still not clearly understood. Our study of insect sRNA responses to viral infection in <em>Myzus persicae</em> and <em>Diaphorina citri</em> has revealed an evolutionarily conserved ability of circulative plant pathogens to regulate antiviral immunity in hemipteran vectors. In both hosts sRNA production against Flaviviruses was nearly abolished when hosts were infected with pathogens <em>C</em>Las (<em>D. citri</em>) and PLRV (<em>M. persicae</em>). This finding opens a new line of research into how insect-specific viruses influence transmission of circulative pathogens. </div>
